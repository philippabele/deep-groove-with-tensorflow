## How to contribute
Contributions to this repo are made via **Issues** and **Pull Requests** (PRs).

### Issues

Issues should be used to report problems, request a new feature, or to discuss potential changes before a PR is created. You can either [**create a new issue**](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue) , in case you spot a problem or work on an already **existing issue**.


### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repository to your own Github account in order to work on the issue without immediately affecting the original version
2. Within the forked repository create a branch with a succinct but descriptive name
3. Commit your changes to the working branch
4. After your changes on the issue are finished, create a PR ([Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)). You can link the respective issue and send the PR to a contributor of the original repository with sufficient permission to accept your PR.
Once your changes meet the requirements, they will be merged into the original repository.

**Now your changes have been contributed to the project!**
